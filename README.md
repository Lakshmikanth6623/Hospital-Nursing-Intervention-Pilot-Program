# Hospital Nursing Intervention Pilot Program

This repository contains code and documentation for the **Hospital Nursing Intervention Pilot Program**. This project aims to improve nursing intervention strategies within a hospital setting by analyzing data, implementing pilot programs, and assessing outcomes to enhance patient care quality and operational efficiency.

## Project Structure

- **Hosiptal_Nurse.Rmd**: This R Markdown file includes the analysis, data processing, and visualization related to the nursing intervention program. The code processes and visualizes the intervention data and extracts insights essential for evaluating the pilot program's impact.

## Project Overview

The project investigates nursing interventions and their outcomes within a hospital environment, focusing on improving patient care through targeted strategies. Data on interventions, patient response, and other relevant metrics are analyzed to identify effective practices.

### Key Features

- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: In-depth analysis of nursing interventions and visual representation of findings.
- **Outcome Evaluation**: Assessments on intervention effectiveness to inform future practices.
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculations of success metrics such as patient satisfaction, intervention response times, and overall care quality.

## Installation and Setup

To replicate the analysis, ensure you have the following dependencies:

- **R**: Required to run the analysis scripts.
- **RMarkdown**: Used to compile the `.Rmd` file into a readable report format.
- **Libraries**: Install the necessary R packages by running:

  ```R
  install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyverse","RSQLite", "DBI")) # Add any other required packages here
